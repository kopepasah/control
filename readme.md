# Control

Code, tools, configs and setup scripts for my local development environment (MacOS and usually on the latest stable version).

:warning: It is unlikely you will use this for your local setup, but more likely as a guide to how you might want to setup your own local environment.

## Installation

0. Download Git (if not already installed)
0. Clone Control recursively into your home (~) directory.
0. Run the desired scripts, found in the `bash` directory.
