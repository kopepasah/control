# Contributing

Contributing to Control requires you to follow the Git Flow model of development. In addition, contributions should include an issue reference, otherwise there is no disucssion of the necessity for the contribution.

## Flow

1. Open a new issue (if one does not already exist).
2. Fork and create a new branch off `master` using the `feature/` or `hotfix/` prefix.
3. Create a pull request to `origin:develop` off this new feature branch.

From here the work really lies on me. I will test the feature (or hotfix) and, if approved, create a branch locally to approve for merging into `master`.
